##Where to Contribute(Workflow)

#### Using GitHub
1.  We can use GitHub flow (branch) to manage changes:
   - Create a new branch in your desktop copy of this repository for each significant change.
   - Commit the change in that branch.
   - Submit a pull request from that branch to the master repository.
   - If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.
   - **If a major change is made by any person, tag other two. If this change is approved by all → accept pull request.

2.   We also use GitHub flow (fork) to manage changes:
   - Fork, then clone this repo
   - Push that branch to your fork of this repository on GitHub.
   - Submit a pull request
   - If you receive feedback, make changes on your desktop and push to your branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically.

##How to Contribute

####Code comment 
- Functions need to be documented clearly.

####Commit message
- Big changes:
  
  ```
$ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
> 
> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

-  Small changes:
   - 1-line detailed message including what change you made.

- Frequent commit everytime you make changes.


####Testing conventions
- We will add details later.

####Coding convention
- Python:

      - All code should in `.py` file rather than jupyter notebook file
- R:
      - We avoid `=` when assign objects. We usually use `->`
      - recommends that contributors use `%>%` which **dplyr** imports from **magrittr**.
      - All code should in `.R` file rather than notebook file.
