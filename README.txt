# regscore-py

A python package that does model comparison between different regression models.


## **Function Description**

Here, we will describe functions in *Phase I*. We will also add a documentation for all functions later.

### AIC

#### Introduction

AIC stands for Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion. It estimates the quality of a model, relative to each of other models. The lower AIC score is, the better the model is. Therefore, a model with lowest AIC - in comparison to others, is chosen.

```
AIC = n*log(residual sum of squares/n) + 2K
```

where:
- n: number of observations
- K: number of parameters (including intercept)

#### Function

```
aic(x, y, n, k, model = 'linear')
```

**Parameters:**
* **x**: ndarray or scipy.sparse matrix, (n_samples, n_features)
  * Predictive variable(s)

* **y**: ndarray, shape (n_samples), or (n_samples, n_targets)
  * Target variable(s)

* **n**: int
  * Number of observations

* **k**: int
  * Number of predictive variable(s) used in the model

* **model**: default 'linear' | 'logistic' | 'ridge' | 'lasso' | 'elasticnet'
  * Method applied to the model

**Return:**
* AIC score of the model: int


### BIC

#### Introduction

BIC stands for Bayesian Information Criterion. Like AIC, it also estimates the quality of a model. When fitting models, it is possible to increase model fitness by adding more parameters. Doing this may results in model overfit. Both AIC and BIC helps to resolve this problem by using a penalty term for the number of parameters in the model. This term is bigger in BIC than in AIC.

```
BIC = n*log(residual sum of squares/n) + K*log(n)
```

where:
- n: number of observations
- K: number of parameters (including intercept)

#### Function

```
bic(x, y, n, k, model = 'linear')
```
**Parameters:**
* **x**: ndarray or scipy.sparse matrix, (n_samples, n_features)
  * Predictive variable(s)

* **y**: ndarray, shape (n_samples), or (n_samples, n_targets)
  * Target variable(s)

* **n**: int
  * Number of observations

* **k**: int
  * Number of predictive variable(s) used in the model

* **model**: default 'linear' | 'logistic' | 'ridge' | 'lasso' | 'elasticnet'
  * Method applied to the model

**Return:**
* BIC score of the model: int

### Mallow's C_p

#### Introduction

Mallow's C_p is named for Colin Lingwood Mallows. It is used to assess the fit of regression model, finding the best model involving a subset of predictive variables available for predicting some outcome.

```
C_p = (SSE_p/MSE) - (n - 2p)
```

where:
- SSE_k: residual sum of squares for the subset model containing `p` explanatory
variables counting the intercept.
- MSE: mean squared error for the full model (model containing all `k` explanatory variables of interest)
- n: number of observations
- p: number of subset explanatory variables

#### Function

```
mallow(X, x_subset, y, n, p, k, model = 'linear')
```

**Parameters:**
* **X**: ndarray or scipy.sparse matrix, (n_samples, n_features)
  * Predictive variable(s)

* **x_subset**: ndarray or scipy.sparse matrix, (n_samples, n_features)
  * Predictive variable(s) in the subset model

* **y**: ndarray, shape (n_samples), or (n_samples, n_targets)
  * Target variable(s)

* **n**: int
  * Number of observations

* **p**: int
  * Number of predictive variable(s) used in the subset model

* **k**: int
  * Number of predictive variable(s) used in the model

* **model**: default 'linear' | 'logistic' | 'ridge' | 'lasso' | 'elasticnet'
  * Method applied to the model

**Return:**
* Mallow's C_p score of the subset model: int


### Table of comparison

#### Function

```
comparison_model(model)
```

**Parameters:**
* **model**: str
  * Models to compare, separate by `,`

**Return:**
* A table with model names and their scores. Demo:

| Model  | AIC | BIC | Mallow's C_p |
|--------|-----|-----|--------------|
| Model1 | 123 | 145 | 156          |
| Model2 | 145 | 134 | 167          |
